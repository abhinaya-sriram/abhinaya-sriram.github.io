Old students of P.S. Higher Secondary School will walk down memory lane on June 17. The alumni will gather at the school campus to celebrate its Alumni Day and for the Golden Jubilee Reunion of 1968 SSLC Batch. This year, more than 400 alumni are expected to attend the celebrations, which will start at 3.30 p.m.

Alumni reunions held at P.S. Higher Secondary School has consistently provided a platform for all the batches to relive student life.

Many illustrious alumni will vouch for that.

M.S. Sundararajan, former chairman and managing director of Indian Bank and an alumnus (1965 SSLC batch), says, “At the morning assembly, I had the opportunity to recite the prayer from the dais. Today, the prayer hall has been converted into TAG-P.S. Dakshinamurthi auditorium, which is the only change in the infrastructure of the school. When I enter the auditorium, I am able to clearly recall how it looked then.”

Seventy nine-year-old R.T. Chari, managing director of TAG Group of Companies, vice-president of The Music Academy and an almnus, says the school gave a lot of importance to sports.

“I developed an interest in sports because of the encouragement the school offered,” he says.

Chari was responsible for modernisation of TAG-P.S.-Dakshinamurthi auditorium in 2014.

According to the organising committee, 95-year-old Lieutenant General C. Sundara Rao is the oldest alumnus of the institution. He will be honoured on the occasion.

R. Sivakumar, chartered accountant and secretary of alumni association of the school; and (retd) group captain R. Vijayakumar, president of Madras Management Association, are among others expected to attend the meet.
