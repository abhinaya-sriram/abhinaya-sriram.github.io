There is nothing like a glass of cool water to slake your thirst on a muggy, swelteringly hot day. But reaching out for a plastic bottle of water, stored in your refrigerator, isn’t necessarily the best thing to do. However, there is a way you can get refreshingly cool water without increasing your carbon footprint — use a mud pot to store your water, instead.

Head across to Kodambakkam High Road in Chennai if you want to get one. Usha Vadivel, who sells them here, offers you a wide range of earthen containers with dispensers conveniently attached to them.

“The pots are made from scratch at a factory outlet and are sent to my store for further detailing,” says Usha.

These pots are available in different sizes and have an elegant artistic touch. The pots, along with the dispensers, range from Rs. 100 to a maximum of Rs. 250, depending on the size. Additionally, she also sells bottles, cups and jug-shaped ones which are available for just Rs. 100. “The idea of promoting mud pots of various shapes and sizes came because plastic bottles are highly unhealthy for the environment. People are beginning to realise this,” says Janaki Kanniappan Udayar, Usha Vadivel’s mother.

Udayar, 66, is an inspiration, because she has been in this business for more than 40 years, and has passed on her interest to her children. She learnt the basics of pottery from her husband, she says. And the next generation seems to be equally enthused by the profession.

“I will continue the family tradition of pottery,” says Ramamoorthy, an architect by profession, who also works with his mother, Usha, at the store.

It helps that these continue to be popular. “We see whopping sales in summer,” says Udayar. “Just like how sarees and dhavanis were in fashion back then, we also want to guarantee products that match with today’s trend,” she laughs. She certainly seems to be succeeding. “I buy mud pots every summer from this particular shop, because they have a good variety and are of excellent quality,” says Sumathi, a customer.
