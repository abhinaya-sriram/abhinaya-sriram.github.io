A casual chat that singer MJ Shriram had with Charles Fabian, the general manager of The Residency, way back in 2009, sowed the seeds for something special. “We were having a discussion on the kind of music that would interest people, and the idea of singing Ilaiyaraaja sir’s songs cropped up,” recalls Shriram. Today, Mind, Body and Soul, the musical concept night that celebrates Ilaiyaraaja songs at the Black & White lounge bar at the hotel, has completed its 400th week.

Shriram loves singing the Ilaiyaraaja-SPB combo numbers, as he feels more connected to them. “There are many new songs that have come up, but I feel that this is my cup of tea,” says the singer.

Shriram has been musically inclined since childhood. “It was my mother who discovered the hidden talent in me,” he says. He grew up listening to Ilaiyaraaja’s songs and describes performing them as a blessing. “I look at it as my first love.”img

Initially, the show saw attendees in the age group of 30-60, but of late, Shriram is noticing many youngsters being drawn to the melodies. Singer SPB Charan, who was present at the 400th week celebrations, says, “There have even been times when I, despite being SPB’s son, couldn’t experience the show, because of the hordes of music lovers who throng the bar. The support that Shriram gets for this initiative gives me a lot of happiness.”
