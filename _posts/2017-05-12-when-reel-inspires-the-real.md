How eager are you in understanding the visual effects (VFX) that have been used in recent blockbuster Baahubali ? Theme park Kishkinta offers you an opportunity to enact a scene from the movie and learn the processing aspect as well.

The game begins while you’re waiting at the entrance of the auditorium. Sanjeevi Raj, who plays the role of ‘Kattappa’, announces to the crowd that the person who jumps the highest wins a chance to play the role of Prabhas and enact the scene (from Baahubali part one) in which he climbs a tall cliff with a breathtaking view.

Jagan, a Class XII student, was chosen as the ‘Baahubali’ of the day, and given instructions on how to perform every move by Kattappa. This was followed by the VFX process, in which Prabhas was replaced by Jagan. “I was extremely thrilled after being chosen and was even more excited to perform on stage. This idea has now encouraged me in considering films as a career option,” said Jagan.

Sanjeevi Raj, who has been into theatre and films for a long time, has been working with the theme park for more than a decade to come up with innovative entertainment options during the summer. “This year, I decided to play the character of Kattappa,” he beams. The main idea behind the current show, according to Raj, is to give audiences a peek into the VFX process that goes on in the film world.

Jose Punnoose, Joint Managing Director, Kishkinta, feels that Baahubali’s use of VFX inspired them to come up with this concept. “In fact, it was the director (SS Rajamouli) who suggested the idea of enacting the cliff-climbing scene, where technology comes into play in a big way.”
