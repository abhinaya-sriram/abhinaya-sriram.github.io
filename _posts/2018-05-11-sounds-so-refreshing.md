The Unwind Center saw live performances by three bands — Ava and Sid, The Lazarus Project and Yaazhi that feature young artistes, who used this platform to exhibit their talent.

The show kickstarted with Ava and Sid, an acoustic duo, who were performing for the first time in Chennai. Singer-songwriter Avanthika, originally from Delhi, shifted base to Chennai recently to chase her dreams. Inspired by the rapidly growing indie scene, she says, “the idea is to introduce new sound and ideas.” Sid, on the other hand is an artiste who simply enjoys music and loves to perform live shows. The duo played a piece that beautifully wove words called out by the audience.

The second band that took the stage was The Lazarus Project. It began its musical journey by coming together for a school cultural programme. Rock being its USP, the band consists of a guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer and a vocalist. “Practising as a group is not easy, but it is our passion for music that holds us together,” says Karthika, the guitarist.

The last and the most-awaited gig was by Yaazhi, a band set up by Kiran Kashyap about a year ago. It believes in experimenting with diverse genres and its playlist includes hits of Ilaiyaraja and A.R.Rahman. Their medley was enjoyed by the audience.

“Live shows are fun, but we are looking more at nurturing new talent and providing a platform to young musicians,” says Eddie Prithviraj, director, Unwind Center.
