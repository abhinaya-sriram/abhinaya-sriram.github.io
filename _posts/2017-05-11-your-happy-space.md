What’s more exciting than playing snooker and PlayStation with a cup of coffee and some snacks with your loved ones? The new sports café named CAFINO – The Game Yard was launched on May 6 by filmmaker Meera Kathiravan, Abi Saravanan and Adhiti, who played the lead roles in the Pattathari . The café is attractive, with well-designed and artistic interiors.

CAFINO consists of a large area with two billiard and four pool tables, made under the Wiraka brand. They also have ample space for PlayStation, Xbox and virtual reality games. The cost per hour for a table would be Rs. 150. They plan to include league matches and competition within the café eventually. And, vouchers will be distributed as gifts for the winners. “We are also looking forward to adding games such as darts, foosball and air hockey,” said Manoj Kumar, managing director, CAFINO.

CAFINO serves a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, such as garlic bread, pizza, noodles and some desserts, apart from the usual beverages. Crawford, an interior designer and art director for movies such as Pasanga , Marina and Thirumanam Enum Nikkah has designed the place. There is a funny story to this.

“I was chatting with my friends. In between, I scribbled a layout on the iPad. It was chosen as the final,” says the designer.

They also have space for DJ nights, stand-up comedy and karaoke for the weekends. The team is also looking forward to setting up more branches across the globe as well.
