That independent music bands aren’t as famous as film musicians is a well-accepted fact. Aiming to upend this trend, music concert Madras Medai, held over the weekend, was an opportunity for budding artists to exhibit their talent to a huge audience. The concert, organized by Madras Records and the Neelam Cultural Centre — set up by director Pa. Ranjith who was also present at the concert — brought forth the message that once up on the stage, everybody is equal.

Madras Medai kick-started with the Sunshine Orchestra that showcased its eight-year journey into music with melodies on string instruments. Taking inspiration from M.S. Subbulakshmi, ‘Kurai Ondrum Illai’ was one of the well-loved numbers that the group played. Another popular song that the band played, ‘Libertango’ by Astor Piazzolla, had elements of jazz fused with classical notes. The band has been undertaking training in different countries to play this song to perfection, making it special.

The next band, Othasevuru, comprised Tharun Sekar and Pravekha Ravichandran. The duo who come from Hosur, had begun their journey in Madurai where shared through their music, the things they came across during their travels. Decked in matching outfits, the duo narrated the stories behind each song, making a stronger connect with the audience.

Independent artist Siennor’s songs had a great level of imagination and hard-hitting lyrics. The audience enjoyed the richness of his voice, paired well with the keyboard in songs like ‘Avan oru medai nadigan’, ‘Poruppu’ and ‘Aval oru puriyaatha puthir’.

The most awaited band was, however, Dopeadelicz featuring Dharavi United, that had come all the way from Mumbai, bringing in even more energy to the packed audience with their folk rap. The band started off by making the audience rap along with them. ‘Aadu Paambey’ was an instant hit with the audience. The band also rapped a Chennai-Kuthu song, urging the crowd to do a few kuthu dance moves. Dharavi United signed off with a dose of beat boxing by one of its members.

Jatayu, a four-member band, performed a subtle yet soothing fusion of Carnatic music with jazz. The band had a great mix of songs; a few of their compositions include ‘Sringara’ and ‘Mood swings’. The drummer, Manu Krishnan, was especially appreciated for his fast beats. The next band was Ofro that started off with an experimental instrumental, overlaying electronic music with violin. The band played ‘October maadham’, a popular song that was released on its YouTube channel.

Before the show’s headliners Paul Jacob with Chinna Ponnu concluded the concert using traditional folk fused with rock to address issues of farmer protests and caste discrimination, The Casteless Collective raised the energy level to a new high with the rap that shot them to fame, ‘Jai Bhim Anthem’— the lyrics of which called for ending discrimination in the society. With its finale collection of songs on NEET examinations, caste reservation system, beef ban, communism and the Cauvery water protests, The Casteless Collective left no socio-political issue untouched.
