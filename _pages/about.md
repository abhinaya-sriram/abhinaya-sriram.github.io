A desire to connect, learn, experience and grow, prompted me to continually feed an insatiable curiosity about the lives of people and the diversity of cultures through a variety of news media. I wish to not just consume news but also learn about effective communication and contribute to sharing information and experiences with a broader audience.

I worked as a Sub-Editor with The Hindu - one of India’s largest English news dailies - for more than 3 years with work centered around Indian and international politics, business, sports and cinema. Majority of my experience involved managing the organisation’s multiple accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. During my stint, I contributed in-depth videos for The Hindu’s YouTube channel and produced more than 300 videos (involving scripting, voiceovers and editing) on a wide range of topics. I have also anchored live coverage of major events like annual budget tabling, election results and court hearings.

I am currently pursuing MA Digital and Social Journalism at City, University of London to further hone my skillset including - data visualisation, podcasting, audience strategy and multimedia management. This comprehensive curriculum equips me with a robust skillset essential for thriving in the dynamic landscape of the digital media industry.
