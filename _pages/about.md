A desire to connect, learn, experience and grow, prompted me to continually feed an insatiable curiosity about the lives of people and the diversity of cultures through a variety of news media. I wish to not just consume news but also learn about effective communication and contribute to sharing information and experiences with a broader audience.

I currently work at The Hindu, Chennai, as a Social Media Manager. I track breaking news and other stories worth a read across social media platforms and design creatives for the organisation. Previously, I worked as a video editor for The Hindu's YouTube channel. I have produced over 140 videos on a wide range of topics. 

Previous internships: The Hindu (MetroPlus and Friday Review), Editorji, CNN-News18 and CNBC TV-18.
