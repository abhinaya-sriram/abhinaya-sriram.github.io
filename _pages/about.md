A desire to connect, learn, experience and grow, prompted me to continually feed an insatiable curiosity about the lives of people and the diversity of cultures through a variety of news media. I wish to not just consume news but also learn about effective communication and contribute to sharing information and experiences with a broader audience.

I’ve been a Sub-Editor with The Hindu - one of India’s largest English news dailies - for more than 2.5 years with work centered around Indian and international politics, business, sports and cinema. I worked as a social media content manager and have experience in managing social media platforms for the organisation. I have anchored live coverage of major events like annual budget tabling, election results and court hearings. Currently, I produce in-depth videos for The Hindu's YouTube channel. I have produced more than 250 videos (involving scripting, providing voiceovers and editing) on a wide range of topics. 

Previous internships: The Hindu (MetroPlus and Friday Review), Editorji, CNN-News18 and CNBC TV-18.
