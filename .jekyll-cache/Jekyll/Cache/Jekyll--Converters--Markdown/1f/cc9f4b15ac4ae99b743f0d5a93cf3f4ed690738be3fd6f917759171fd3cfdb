I"½<p>Worried about your children being addicted to gadgets? Hereâ€™s a sport that may see a change in the trend amongst children today.</p>

<p>At the Fit Rock Arena (Pallikaranai) thatâ€™s equipped with indoor climbing activities, one can train in the sport of climbing. To celebrate their first anniversary, a competition was recently organised, comprising over 60 participants from various age groups.</p>

<p>The place has a simple interior with posters of champions pasted all around the walls, to inspire participants. Peppy songs played in the background as pre-climbing instructions were given out.</p>

<p>Some participants have had previous training in the field while the others have walked in to check their abilities.</p>

<p>â€œWhen my daughter Manya was younger, she used to enjoy climbing anything she found around her. Looking at the interest she showed towards this sport, I ensured that she gets good training,â€ said Anu Ganapathy, a parent.</p>

<p>This sport helps in muscle building and also develops concentration.</p>

<p>â€œThis sport requires a lot of strategising and will develop thinking skills among children,â€ said Lakshmi Priya Somasundaram, another parent whose daughter, Keerthana Triya Kidambi enjoys climbing and was a participant in the sub-junior category.</p>

<p>â€œThere isnâ€™t much of an awareness on rock climbing in Chennai and with this arena we want to change that,â€ said Shyam Manoharan, founder, Fit Rock Arena.</p>

<p>â€œWe have difficulty levels planned according to the category the participants belong to,â€ Manoharan added.</p>

<p>â€œThe main objective behind indoor climbing is to excel outdoors,â€ said J Gaurav, a member. â€œWhile men climbers use only power after a certain point, the women have good footwork and use amazing techniques,â€ he added.</p>
